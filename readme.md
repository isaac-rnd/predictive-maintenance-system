# Predictive Maintenance System

## Overview
The **Predictive Maintenance System** leverages AI/ML with GenAI and real-time analytics to forecast potential equipment failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and minimize operational downtime.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Collects sensor data from IoT-enabled devices.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Uses machine learning to identify deviations in equipment behavior.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Forecasts failures and maintenance needs using historical data.
- **Alerting & Notifications:** Sends alerts when anomalies or potential failures are detected using genai for proper formation of the flow of the application.
- **Dashboard & Visualization:** Provides an intuitive UI for monitoring and analytics.

## Tech Stack
- **Cloud Platform:** Azure & Kafka Cloud
- **Big Data Processing:** Apache flink usage is the idea
- **Machine Learning:** Python, Sklearn's Random forest is used in this implementation
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java) for API services
- **Frontend (Optional):** Streamlit
